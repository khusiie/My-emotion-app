This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Project Description
Emotion Check‚Äëin is a responsive, accessible, and beautifully animated mood tracker built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It offers a pixel-perfect implementation of a Figma design, enabling users to:

Select their current emotion via interactive, animated cards with hover and selection effects.

Add optional notes with a live character counter and 500-character limit enforcement.

Submit check-ins via a mocked API (using JSONPlaceholder), complete with loading state and clear success/error messages.

Experience smooth micro-interactions, powered by Framer Motion, including card scaling and button ripple effects.

Benefit from performance optimizations, such as memoization and minimal re-renders, targeting Lighthouse scores of 85+.

Use a fully accessible interface, with keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and WCAG-compliant color contrast.
